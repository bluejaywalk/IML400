    <p>I found Diana Nucera’s Eyeo talk to be incredibly inspiring. She reviewed her efforts over the past 13 years to use media as a decentralized community organizing tool. I’m also fascinated by her community technology pedagogy and her DJing, but what was perhaps the most exciting aspect of her work was her principles for digital justice. Her method of teaching others to build their own networks, computers, and technology is wonderful: the networks are being built by the people actually using them. <br>
	I feel that this is somewhat related to MA+P’s outlook in that both Nucera and MA+P are trying to take people from consumers of media to equitable producers of media. While Nucera’s approach is much more decentralized and accessible, both methods work to create a thriving digital ecosystem.

	We discussed the virtual care lab last semester in IML 300, but revisiting the site was still a wonderful experience. It’s so easy to get caught up in “hustle culture,” especially during this time in our lives, where finding a job or internship is seen as the end all be all of school. For me, the virtual care lab isn’t so much about the site, the field trips, or the technology, it’s more about the concept and the community involved. Given how top-down tech is these days, it’s fantastic to see positive ground-up communities flourish and connect people to each other.

My group questions for this week are:
How can Diana Nucera’s pedagogy be applied to other areas such as school and trade craft? Is it realistic at scale for these applications?
What are the differences between Diana Nucera’s way of teaching and USC’s? Do you think one could benefit from the other, and how so?
What would a fully decentralized web look like? What changes would need to be made in order to get there?
