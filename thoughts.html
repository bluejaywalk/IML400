    <h2>Reading 2 (Week 2):</h2>
    <p>I found Diana Nucera’s Eyeo talk to be incredibly inspiring. She reviewed her efforts over the past 13 years to use media as a decentralized community organizing tool. I’m also fascinated by her community technology pedagogy and her DJing, but what was perhaps the most exciting aspect of her work was her principles for digital justice. Her method of teaching others to build their own networks, computers, and technology is wonderful: the networks are being built by the people actually using them. <br>
        I feel that this is somewhat related to MA+P’s outlook in that both Nucera and MA+P are trying to take people from consumers of media to equitable producers of media. While Nucera’s approach is much more decentralized and accessible, both methods work to create a thriving digital ecosystem.

         We discussed the virtual care lab last semester in IML 300, but revisiting the site was still a wonderful experience. It’s so easy to get caught up in “hustle culture,” especially during this time in our lives, where finding a job or internship is seen as the end all be all of school. For me, the virtual care lab isn’t so much about the site, the field trips, or the technology, it’s more about the concept and the community involved. Given how top-down tech is these days, it’s fantastic to see positive ground-up communities flourish and connect people to each other.
       
        <br> <br>
        How can Diana Nucera’s pedagogy be applied to other areas such as school and trade craft? Is it realistic at scale for these applications? <br>
        What are the differences between Diana Nucera’s way of teaching and USC’s? Do you think one could benefit from the other, and how so? <br>
        What would a fully decentralized web look like? What changes would need to be made in order to get there?

    <h2>Reading 3 (Week 6):</h2>
    <p>The cyberfeminism index is a wonderful site with hundreds of links to sites, projects, and manifestos, all arranged in a helpful timeline spanning from 1985-2020. The index also provides a broad perspective on cyberfeminism: unless you’re closely tracking cyberfeminism, it’s easy to only see the large projects that have broken into the mainstream, which unfortunately doesn’t happen enough. The index illustrates how much activity there is in the world of cyberfeminism, and how viewpoints have evolved over time. One feature I particularly enjoy about the index is that it displays a history of who has downloaded each project, letting you catch a glimpse of other users in this virtual community. </p>

        For this week I also read chapter 6 of Data Feminism, entitled “The Numbers Don’t Speak for Themselves.” The chapter did a fantastic job explaining the importance of data interpretation in modern life. “Raw data” can be meaningless without interpretation, but it is the very interpretation that is subject to social, political, and historical bias. As the chapter tells us, context is everything when it comes to data, and data stripped of context is open to the bias that interpretation brings.

        <br> <br>
        How can institutions like USC encourage data literacy? Should a data literacy course be part of USC’s requirements for graduation? What problems does this pose? <br>
        In Data Feminism, “subjugated knowledge” is defined as “the forms of knowledge that have been pushed out of mainstream institutions and the conversations they encourage.” What are some real life examples of subjugated knowledge? What is the significance of these forms of knowledge being excluded from the mainstream? <br>
        As the internet becomes an ever larger presence in modern society, what new challenges does the cyberfeminism movement face? How have these challenges evolved over time?

    <h2>Reading 4 (Week 7):</h2>
    <p>To be honest, I wish I had consumed the three readings in reverse order. Lee and Toliver’s “Building Consentful Tech” zine was rousing, uplifting, and generally hopeful. While it was somewhat alarming to visualize the many different places my “digital body” lives, the zine is mainly an instructional manual explaining how and why we need to build consentful tech. I have heard the “fail faster” maxim from several students I know in the Marshall School of Business, and I knew I didn’t like the motto but I couldn’t put my finger on why. This zine perfectly describes how the “fail faster” culture is flat out dangerous for users, and I really appreciate that. It was also refreshing to read a zine about consent and tech that included powerful phrases like “We can and must do better.” </p>
       <p>
        Coklyat and Finnegan’s “Alt-Text as Poetry” was definitely the most abstract reading for the week. It was helpful to get a reminder of the importance of alt-text, but the call to action wasn’t completely clear to me. I understand that we as creators need to take more care in writing alt-text and that we can learn from poets, but thinking of alt-text as poetry was a bit of a reach for me. I definitely need to do more thinking about this, but that was my initial reaction after reading. <br>
        “The New Organs” site is alarming, to say the least. Three years of MA+P has numbed me to the horrible invasions of data privacy, but both the video and gallery were effective in explaining the core of the issue, how people feel about it, and the problems the people are reporting. I also found the narrator’s whispering to be an effective vocal choice, as it felt as though they were sharing secrets with me, or having a conversation that they did not want to be overheard.
        <br> <br>
        What is an experience that happened to you that you would submit to “The New Organs” site? Why did you choose this experience, and what impact did it have on you? <br>
        What specific things could USC do to promote consentful tech? <br>
        What other problems can you see with the “fail faster” maxim? What are other dangers of this maxim?

       <h2>Reading 5 (Week 8):</h2>
       <p>I really enjoyed reading “What are the characteristics that are distinct to indigenous technology?” Many books, articles, and blogs have approached the subject in a dry, impersonal method, either jumbling the topic in dense academic text or referring to indigenous technologies as lesser and more primitive than “modern” western technologies. This text was different in every imaginable way, starting with the fact that its form is that of a poem. The lines move smoothly from one to the next, making eye-opening points along the way. I was particularly struck by the section about how indigenous technologies have the obligation to come into existence, effectively countering the view that technology should be created simply because we can.</p>
       <p>
	While the Postcolonial Computing reading wasn’t quite as engaging, the subject matter was just as interesting. It’s easy to look at programs such as the one laptop per child program as universally positive, but taking a more holistic approach is necessary in order to fully understand why programs such as these are ultimately reductive and regressive. This reading is helpful for shifting one’s perspective on the present and future technology in a postcolonial computing environment.
           <br> <br>
           What are some concrete ways we can apply indigenous technology theories to our own personal technology practice, especially during quarantine? <br>
How can MA+P apply postcolonial computing theories into the curriculum (whether through new classes or new teaching methods)? <br>
What are some problems with “modern” western technologies that are addressed with indigenous technologies?

       <h2>Reading 6 (Week 10):</h2>
       <p>The design principles of the design justice network and the Eyeo talk from Sasha Constanza-Chock were eye opening, to say the least. While I had previously recognized the nature of discriminatory design, I was unaware of the extent to which design affects our everyday lives. Two major sections of the talk stood out to me: The matrix of domination and the distribution of the design process. It’s hard not to notice white supremacy, heteropatriarchy, ableism, and forms of predatory capitalism in everyday life, and it is relatively easy to read about the problems with these individual systems. But Sasha Constanza-Chock talked about how these and other forms of structural inequality work together in interlocking systems of oppression in a “matrix of domination.” This is a wonderful term that helps to describe how taking down white supremacy isn’t enough because of how closely it is tied with heteropatriarchy, which is in turn tied with ableism, and so on. </p>
       <p>
	I also love the proposal to move people with technical skills and knowledge of the system from the center of the design process, and refocus on community members who are affected by the design choices. These people should absolutely be front and center in the design process as they are the experts, not the designers. The design principles did a fantastic job of explaining how designers and developers should support communities that are impacted through design justice. I hope one day these design justice network principles could be required reading for all introductory design courses, as making these principles the industry standard would have enormous benefits for the many people who are being failed by current design practices.
           <br> <br>
           Can you think of an example of how current design practices tie in with the matrix of domination? Who is benefiting/not benefitting from this example? <br>
Can you think of an example of when community members were at the center of the design process instead of outside designers with technical expertise? How would this example differ if those affected were pushed out of the design process? <br>
Under what circumstances would design firms and large corporations be open to the design justice network principles? Do you think it’s feasible that they could become industry standards?

       <h2>Reading 7 (Week 11):</h2>
       <p>This week’s readings were incredibly engaging for me. I am currently learning ASL and am generally very interested in “disability” based media, and music so I loved Christine Sun Kim’s TED talk. I’ve been creating music visualizers for a few years now, but I have not spent much time thinking about music from a deaf person’s perspective. Christine Sun Kim’s work in drawing out interpretations of sound and creating sound experiences aligns so perfectly with my interests that I ended up taking triple the amount of notes I usually take, despite the fact the TED talk was only 15 minutes long. I was especially interested in the piano metaphor, and the way she looked at ASL (and the world) through a musical lens. </p>
       <p>
	Inclusive design is central to IML 300 and 400, but Gregory Brandon’s “Designing for Cognitive Differences” was the first article I read that has talked about designing specifically for people with ADHD, anxiety, and depression. While I have anxiety and depression, I was not aware of how these issues can impact people’s web experience. The example I found most helpful was the GIF example: that people with attention problems often have trouble reading articles with nonessential, looping GIFs as the GIFs distract too much from the message of the article, and need to be disabled. This type of design thinking can be somewhat difficult to achieve, as many neurotypical designers can’t simply call up someone with ADHD every five minutes to ask if their site is functional. Yet this way of thinking is incredibly important, as it is vital that the web (and media in general) be accessible and open to all. 
           <br> <br>
           How can those with less “social currency” gain social currency? Who controls social currency and why does such a concept exist? <br>
Are there scenarios where making content more accessible for some makes the content less accessible for others? What is a solution in this scenario? <br>
Have you ever faced a design accessibility issue on the internet that prevented you from consuming content the way you would prefer to? How did you resolve the issue?
